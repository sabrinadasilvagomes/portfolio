            <h2>Project: Bird Application</h2>
            <h3>Focus: Visual and making content</h3>

            <p>For this project, I had to create a product or service based on a passionate idea. We had to create something for someone special, something that could be valuable for that specific person. We could choose that person ourselves. Every person in the project group had their tasks and skills they wanted to get better at. My part in this project was the design and content.</p>

              <h3>The process</h3>

              <h4>Research</h4>
              <p>One of my teammates came up with the idea to develop an application for her sister, Ingeborg. Her sister had studied biology and needed to be able to recognize birds for her new job. The goal was to develop an app that would allow her to practice recognizing different kinds of birds. My task was to create the design for the application. I also made the logo. My other teammate did the illustrations of the birds, and the other one coded the application.</p>
              <img src="images/onderzoek.png" alt="Drawing of a flower association for the project. In this mindmap are several ideas for the application.">

              <h4>Struggles during the process</h4>
              <p>In the beginning, I found it quite difficult because I had too many ideas for the application. I was not only responsible for the design, but also the content. I had to create multiple ways so that Ingeborg could practice recognizing birds. The goal was to make it as fun as possible. After all, that's how you learn the fastest.</p>
              <p>There were also some struggles when I needed to find the perfect design and setup for the application. For example, my first icons were not very clear. I tested this on several people and at first, they didn't quite understand what it meant. I made multiple iterations until I was happy with them. I also struggled a bit with the color palettes. I made way too many choices. Next time I should make a better selection. There were too many color palettes. When I showed them to my colleagues, they found it quite difficult to choose as well. Next time, I will be stricter and choose a selection beforehand. In the end, we voted, and (my favorite) color palette was chosen.</p>

              <h4>How did I solve this</h4>
              <p>I wrote all my ideas on a piece of paper. Then I immediately started sketching to make my ideas a little clearer for the rest of the group. This also helped me choose which features are the best for reaching our goals. The color palette problem was something I had to solve too. I chose the 3 best palettes and shared them with my teammates. Now it was much easier for them to make a choice. I incorporated these color palettes into the homepage. This way, my team could immediately see what the application would eventually look like with this palette.</p>

              <h4>Important insights for next projects</h4>  
              <p>List your ideas. By doing this, everything will be much clearer for you. Very important is to be not (too) perfectionistic when sketching. It doesn't matter that it's not perfect. Sketches don't have to be perfect at all. Often, it is very clear to someone else. Only you see the flaws in the sketch. It’s also important that I make choices about important parts before I show them to my group. If you show everything at once, it will be too much information. They only want to see the most important choices about design and content.</p>

              <h4>What did I think of this project?</h4>
              <p>This was a very interesting project. I liked the fact that you could choose which skill you wanted to improve. I feel that I gained many more new insights that are useful for my next projects. Next time, I will better understand how to start a project and collect as many ideas as possible. I learned which information you should show while you meet with the team and how much information you should share with them. </p>
