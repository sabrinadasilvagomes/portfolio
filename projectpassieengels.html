            <h2>Project: Bird Application</h2>
            <h3>Focus: Visual and making content</h3>

            <p>For this project, I had to create a product or service based on a passion with my project group. We had to design this concept for a specific person that we could choose ourselves. So, we were allowed to make anything we could think of. My part in this project is the design and the content. </p>

              <h3>The process</h3>

              <h4>Research</h4>
              <p>One of my teammates came up with the idea to develop an application for her sister, Ingeborg. Her sister had studied biology and she needed to be able to recognize birds for her new job. The goal was to develop an app that would allow her to practice recognizing birds. My responsibility was the design. I also made the logo. My other teammate did the illustrations of the birds and the other teammate coded the application which made it all real.</p>
              <img src="images/onderzoek.png" alt="Drawing of a flower association for the project. In this mindmap are several ideas for the application.">

              <h4>Struggles during the process</h4>
              <p>In the beginning, I found it quite difficult because I had too many ideas. I was not only responsible for the design, but also the content. So, I had to come up with ways for Ingeborg to practice recognizing birds. The goal was to make it as fun as possible. After all, that's how you learn the fastest. The assignment was to come up with fun learning methods so that I could make a selection of the best idea.</p>
              <p>There were also some struggles when I needed to find the perfect design and setup for the application. For example, my first icons were not very clear. I tested this on several people and at first, they didn't quite understand what it meant. So, I made some iterations of this. I also made multiple palettes for the color scheme. I will have to be more critical about this next time. I had too many choices, which made it quite difficult. In the end, we voted and (my favorite) was chosen.</p>

              <h4>How did I solve this</h4>
              <p>In the end, I put all of the ideas on paper. Then I immediately started sketching to make my ideas a little clearer for the rest of the project group. This also allowed me to choose which functions the application should need to reach our goals. With the color scheme, I eventually chose the 3 best palettes. Then I showed this again to my teammates. Now it was much easier for them to make a choice. I incorporated these color palettes into the homepage. In this way my team could immediately see what this would eventually look like.</p>

              <h4>Important insights for next projects</h4>  
              <p>List your ideas. This makes everything much clearer for yourself. I will also not be (too) perfectionistic when sketching in the future. It doesn't matter at all that it's not perfect. Sketches don't have to be perfect at all. Often it is very clear to someone else, while you only see the flaws yourself. It is also important that next time I make selections for important parts, in this way it is not too much information for the rest of the team and you can research more specifically what the best options are.</p>

              <h4>What did I think of this project?</h4>
              <p>I found this project very interesting. I liked the fact that you could really choose your focus for the project. (Or something you wanted to get better at). I also feel that I have gained many more new insights. Next time I will have a better understanding of how to start a project and find as many ideas as possible. I also learned which information you should show the rest of the team and how to make selections of these important things.</p>
