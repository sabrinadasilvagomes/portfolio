        <h2>Project: Virtually Human</h2>
        <h3>Focus: UX/Visual Design</h3>

        <p>“Develop a user-friendly solution for Virtually Human customers, to create animation code strings that they can customize and add to their Digital Human platform.”</p>

        <section>
          <img src="images/projectpage2mockup.png" alt="Mockup from a laptop showcasing the Virtually Human Animation Dashboard that we created.">

          <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <h4>Virtually Human is an innovative project that is concerned with the possibility of combining human emotions with the power of new technology.  As a result, they are attempting to make their interactions with chatbots more "human" and "personal." A very innovative concept, of which there are currently few products on the market.</h4>
            <p>Virtually Human would like to provide its (potential) customers a chance to see what they have to offer and the option to use their digital humans in accordance with previously written code strings. In order to notify the customers about the service they provide, Virtually Human needs a user-friendly interface. Unfortunately, this interface does not yet exist. The CMD Agency team is working to find a solution to this situation.</p>
            <p>A digital human is a relatively new idea. A very futuristic concept that many people are still unfamiliar with.  It is crucial to provide a clear and informative user interface that will enable businesses to add and modify animations that are specifically tailored for the chatbot on their website. The website generates a code on the basis of the previously mentioned animations like "smile" or "worried". These code strings can then be included in their own chatbot. Two UX designers, one front-end developer, and two back-end developers made up the team. My responsibilities included research and visual/UX design. We used the Scrum methodology while working collaboratively to produce a solid, functional product.</p>
            <img src="images/projectpage2chatbot.png" alt="Image of a chatbot example.">

          <h3>The Problem</h3>
            <p>Virtually Human is a company that specializes in creating digital humans. These can be customized and incorporated by businesses into their chatbot system. However, there is still one important component missing from the digital chatbot: the emotions and movements that it is capable of expressing.</p>
            <p>It is necessary to create specific "code strings" in order to allow the Digital Human to act as a human. These code strings are already written to be used, but for someone who hasn't worked with this before this may be challenging to understand. In order to generate the code for animations, Virtually Human requires a "user-friendly" dashboard.</p>
            <img src="images/projectpage2mila.png" alt="Image of the Digital Human that we are going to implement in the Animation Dashboard.">
            <p>In the current situation, businesses will need to manually modify code, as well as understand and use the correct terminology. Although chatbot technology and the technology for Digital Humans are both there, many users find them difficult to use. Due to the fact that Digital Humans' technology is still very new, it may be intimidating to use for the first time. It is our responsibility to design and implement this on a safe and interactive basis.</p>


          <h3>Context</h3>
            <h4>Current Solutions</h4>
              <p>Virtually Human currently maintains a website that provides information on Digital Humans and the skills they possess. What steps you can take to make this happen on your own website are briefly described here. The website does not contain the code strings for the emotions. It is therefore not clear which code strings are available to humanize your digital human.</p>
              <p>Virtually Human has asked us to create a user-friendly user interface that integrates chatbots with virtual human technology. Customers must be able to create their own animations for chatbots using this dashboard. The integration of these animations into chatbot systems should be simple. Virtually Human collaborates with Trulience. This business generated the code strings for Digital Humans and provides them to Virtually Human. Additionally, Trulience created a demo website where users can look at the code strings, however, it is not particularly user-friendly. Some code strings aren't working as well, so we'll have to test those too.</p>
              <img src="images/projectpage2demo.png" alt="Image of the current dashboard from Trulience.">
            

            <h4>Stakeholders</h4>
              <p>Virtually Human</p>
              <p>Virtually Human requires a dashboard that can support its customers by integrating a Digital Human into its chatbot system. This will ensure that Virtually Human can help more clients because the entire process is easier to use. The Dashboard will reduce anxiety surrounding this subject and will make it easier for the client to integrate without the constant help of Virtually Human.</p>
              <p>Clients of Virtually Human</p>
              <p>Both large and small organizations who wish to quickly add a virtual human to their chatbot systems are clients of Virtually Human. The relationship with their clientele will become more intimate and humane by integrating a Digital Human. They will likely receive a different response from their customers as a result of this. Hopefully a more positive one. We talked to one of these interested parties. A potential client of Virtually Human, Pharmi.</p>
              <p>Clients of Virtually Human's Clients</p>
              <p>These groups of stakeholders are people who will undoubtedly interact with the chatbots developed by Virtually Human. They desire to have a more compassionate understanding of the inquiries and issues that have arisen. They have a problem or a question and want to find a solution while chatting with customer service.</p>

            <h4>Target Audience</h4>
              <p>Large and small businesses that want to integrate Digital Humans into their chatbot systems make up the target market for the designs we create. Retail websites such as bol.com can be considered here, as well as educational institutions, government websites, and other instances.</p>
              <p>The company's developers are responsible for making sure the website functions properly. They need to set up and configure the Digital Human before using it. However, specific code sequences are required in order to allow the Digital Human to function properly. The target group consists of individuals who understand coding but require additional assistance to find the specific code strings for the animations.</p>
              <img src="images/projectpage2mila2.jpg" alt="Image of the Digital Human, she is dressed as a doctor.">

            <h4>Research</h4>
              <p>Desk Research</p>
              <p>Virtually Human is a rather futuristic notion, and this may evoke certain emotions. There is a lot of discussion about the theoretical future. Additionally, it varies greatly by country. Research indicates that ignorance and a failure to understand new technologies are the major issues. They do not believe it to be trustworthy and are certain that it will be abused. It is vital for us to inform the user and help them understand this new technology. They will adopt this new technology more readily now that their fears have subsided. Thus, it's important to provide information in "easy" and "clear" language so that every person can understand.</p>

              <p>Interview AI-expert</p>
              <p>Christiaan Meijer, an AI expert working at the eScience Center, was spoken to in order to learn more about working with AI while maintaining ethical standards. Working ethically is crucial, as Christiaan informed us. This can be achieved by declaring unequivocally that the object is a chatbot. He is intrigued by the idea of integrating a Digital Human into a chatbot.</p>
              <p>The most important takeaway from this interview is that you must take away the fear of using a Digital Human. As a distributor of Digital Humans, you are responsible to provide information. Let it be clear that the user is interacting with a chatbot and not a deep fake.</p>
          

          <h3>Vision</h3>
            <h4>Design Challenge</h4>
              <p>“Develop a user-friendly solution for Virtually Human customers, to create animation code strings that they can customize and add to their Digital Human platform.”</p>
        
            <h4>Future Scenario</h4>
              <p>In the near future, it is anticipated that the use of digital humans would gain wider acceptance. The anxiety felt by users will diminish as more information on Digital Humans and how to use them becomes available, and these people will more readily accept this new form of technology. Additionally, there is a chance for significant diversity in Digital Humans.</p>
              <p>More businesses will want to add a Digital Human to their chatbot as users become more adept at using this brand-new technology. This means that there is a greater demand for Digital Humans, which Virtually Human will deliver to users. Quite positive for Virtually Human. There are more businesses that provide digital humans, but since Virtually Human now provides a dashboard on top of the Digital Human, they will be different than the competition.</p>

            <h4>Requirements List</h4>
              <p>There are a number of requirements for this application to be successful. Elements that the user wants to see in order to get the most out of their experience with it. These elements can be classified as "must haves," "should haves," and "could haves".</p>
                <p>Must Haves</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>As a user, I must easily be able to adjust the motions of the eyes, brows, mouth, and head movements.</li>
                    <li>As a user, I must be aware of which code string to use for a specific action.</li>
                    <li>As a user, I must be able to easily copy the code sequence.</li>
                    <li>As a user, I must be able to see a live preview of the Digital Human and the animations that it is capable of showing.</li>
                    <li>The product must be complementary to Virtually Human's website.</li>
                  </ul>

              <p>Should Haves</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>As a user, I need to be able to see which animations are available in the form of images.</li>
                  <li>As a user, I must be able to personalize the Digital Human according to my preferences.</li>
                  <li>The product must be maintainable by Virtually Human.</li>
                </ul>

              <p>Could Haves</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>As a user, I must be able to configure whether or not the subtitling is visible.</li>
                  <li>As a user, I must be able to create animation sequences containing multiple emotions.</li>
                  <li>The product must provide an authentication feature so that not everyone may use the service.</li>
                </ul>
          

          <h3>Concept Sketches</h3>
            <p>First and foremost, we started with sketching any ideas related to the debrief and the requirements list. Therefore, a good overview of all the features that needed to return to the dashboard appeared. The Front-end/Back-end team had a rough idea of how it would look and what they could set up for work-related activities by doing this. The goal of the back-end team at that time was to develop a working code for the dashboard's features.</p>
            <img src="images/projectpage2sketches1.png" alt="First sketches on animation dashboard, lo-fi.">
            <p>Here you can see how we planned to arrange the elements on the screen. The use of a carousel was the forerunner. Given that there are so many categories, this was the most effective way to rank them. Based on research, it was determined that we might reduce user anxiety by making the process simple and clear. Choosing an interface that doesn't require the user to stop and think in order to understand how everything works was therefore quite important.</p>
            <img src="images/projectpage2sketches2.png" alt="Layout for the animation dashboard, mi-fi.">


          <h3>Prototype</h3>
            <p>The final product is an Animation Dashboard from which Virtually Human's customers can input code strings, that correspond to the movements and emotions of a Digital Human.</p>
            <img src="images/projectpage2prototype.png" alt="Mockup of the Animation Dashboard and Animation Catalog.">
          
            <h4>Components of the dashboard</h4>
              <p>View the animation variations under the various categories.</p>
              <p>Browse through many categories, such as "Eyes," "Brows," and "Mouth." Search through the various animations that belong under these categories and add them to your Digital Human.</p>
              <img src="images/projectpage2elements1.png" alt="Part of the Animation catalog. Elements like eyes, brows and mouth.">
              
              <p>Code editor</p>
              <p>The Code Editor is available for more experienced AI developers. Not satisfied with your animation? Using the Code Editor, fine-tune this. Work in the text editor or use the buttons to accomplish this. This is added to the timeline by clicking "Add to animation."</p>
              <img src="images/projectpage2elements2.png" alt="Image of the code editor that is part of the animation dashboard.">

              <p>Your Animation</p>
              <p>The information is displayed on the left side of the dashboard as soon as you input something. Check the timeline to see which variations have been added. Still, something to change? Modify the code in the text editor. Click "Play animation" to view the complete code preview. If you are completely satisfied, you can copy the code or save it as a PDF file.</p>
              <img src="images/projectpage2elements3.png" alt="Your animation is also part of animation dashboard.">
              <video controls>

              </video>
          

          <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>We tested ways to solve the issue of developers lacking the necessary code strings to interact with the Digital Human. We intend to convince future clients of Virtually Human to use the service by building something that makes it genuinely simple to use. According to our thinking, this problem can be solved by creating a user-friendly dashboard. Users are now able to easily search across animation categories. Subsequently, less experienced AI engineers are also able to work with Digital Humans. Developers with more experience have the option to fine-tune the code even further using specific buttons. Users can quickly view the animation by using the preview button. It is clear to see how the animation will be displayed on the Digital Human.</p>
            <p>If the user wants more details regarding the Digital Human or the dashboard, they can find more information in the User Guide.  You can find detailed information about this new technology. The user can also look through the Animation Catalog to learn more about emotions and movements. Each animation that is present in the dashboard is listed here. At the conclusion of this project, there is also ongoing communication with a potential future client of Virtually Human. This company was thrilled by the dashboard and came up with a number of useful insights that have been incorporated into the end design.</p>
