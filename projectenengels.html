          <h2>Project: Artis Royal Zoo</h2>
          <h3>Focus: UX - UI - New tech</h3>

          <p>For this project, I had to come up with a total concept, so that children could determine the way through the Artis Royal Zoo Park. The target audience was children between the ages of 7 and 12. The concept was supposed to solve navigating in the park. You also had to think about crowds, the role of parents, etc.</p>

            <h3>The process</h3>
            <h4>Research</h4>
            <p>Research has shown that children learn faster by playing an adventurous game, being challenged or, having to follow a story. The story of my concept was that Artis de Partis (the Artis mascot) had lost his family in the park. The kids had to help him find them using a magnifying glass tablet. They could choose where they wanted to go, take quizzes and catch the relatives in AR.</p>

            <h4>Struggles during the process</h4>
            <p>I had a certain idea in my head at the beginning. I got stuck in my first idea too much and wasn't open to other ideas. In the beginning, I wasn't sure on which device I could execute my idea. I was only thinking about using a tablet or a smartphone. Eventually, I started to think outside the box and many more unique ideas came to me. As an example, this "magnifying glass tablet".</p>

            <h4>How did I solve this</h4>
            <p>I didn't want to let go of my first idea, but I looked at it again from a new perspective. By writing down all kinds of keywords for my idea, the final concept became increasingly clear. The words "quest" and "adventure" were ultimately the keywords that led me to go for a magnifying glass tablet. That fits my concept.</p>

            <h4>Important insights for next projects</h4>  
            <p>When I will do a next project, I will try to not get stuck in my first idea. Because of this, you miss out on so many fun, unique ideas. Writing down keywords has also been very helpful to me. In this way you can also come up with very nice, new ideas. Just write down everything that comes to mind. Afterward, you can pick out the best things.</p> 
              
            <h4>What did I think of this project?</h4>
            <p>It was a really fun project to do because I'm a big Artis Royal Zoo fan myself. When I saw that this project was available, I started working on it very enthusiastically. I am very proud of the result. After a somewhat difficult start, I got the process off to a good start. Especially the illustrations that I have drawn myself to complete this project.</p>
