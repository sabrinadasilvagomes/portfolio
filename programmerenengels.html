            <h2>Introduction to Programming</h2>
            <h3>Focus: HTML, CSS and Javascript</h3>

            <p>For the course "Introduction to Programming" I had to design and code a little game. This was my first time working with Javascript. I chose to make a game where a "Bookworm" had to collect books. When the bookworm found all 4 books, you could restart the game.</p>

            <section>
              <img src="images/coderengevangen.png" alt="picture of the Bookworm game.">

              <h3>The process</h3>
              <h4>Research</h4>
              <p>First, I had to figure out what I wanted to make. I love reading and wanted to use this in my game. Then the "bookworm" idea came up. I first sketched how I wanted to design it. In the end, I started working out all elements digitally. Then I had to think for myself which elements should be on the page (buttons, H1, H2, etc.)</p>
              
              <h4>Struggles during the process</h4>
              <p>As I mentioned above, this was my first-time coding with Javascript. So, I found this very exciting to do. The basic elements with HTML and CSS all went pretty smoothly. My first struggle was moving the bookworm. This had to be done with the arrow keys. After a lot of research, it worked. Mainly because I checked the console.</p>
              <p>My next struggle was that the browser needed to know when a booklet had to "disappear". So, I need to know the location of the bookworm and the location of each booklet. With this information, I could indicate that if the bookworm was near the location of the booklet so the booklet should disappear. This was a difficult process and cost me a lot of time. In the end, I succeeded.</p>

              <h4>How did I solve this</h4>
              <p>So, in the end, it all worked out. I got tips from the teacher and student assistants (when it still didn't work, even my mother helped me find resources on the Internet). Thanks to all the tips I went along and found the solution. On the internet, I found many tips that helped me along my way. With the IfElse statements, I tried to write down for myself beforehand, what I wanted to achieve and what had to be done differently. By writing this down clearly for myself, it also makes much more sense to code. Then you know much better what you are doing.</p>

              <h4>Important insights for next projects</h4>  
              <p>The next time I start coding, I will take with me that I write down in advance which elements I need. This allows you to immediately create a logical layout. (For example, this is an H1, this is a button). I will do this again with IfElse statements because I still find them difficult. Furthermore, it is much better to keep searching yourself, than to have the answer given like that. You learn it much better by doing it step by step than by copying something.</p>

              <h4>What did I think of this project?</h4>
              <p>I thought it was quite a difficult project. This was because I got stuck on some parts for a very long time. On the other hand, it was also very educational, because you now know much better how it works. By following these steps, I now understand what I have done. I am therefore quite proud of the end result. Maybe it's not very spectacular for other people, but for the first time I'm very happy that I managed to make this result.</p>
